Alfred 2 layout workflow
========================

A simple window layouter based on an Alfred 2 workflow.

# Description

* The workflow itself is quite simple just typ in the keyword "lay" (or chose another of your liking) followed by:
* full = Maximize
* left, right, top, bottom = Halves of screen
* topleft, topright, bottomleft, bottomright = Quaters of screen
* 11,12,13,21,22,23,31,32,33 = Thrids of screen
* 11-12,11-13,11-21,11-22 ... = Some other sizes based on thrids
* ... well the script is quite flexible, so I'm waiting for suggestions
